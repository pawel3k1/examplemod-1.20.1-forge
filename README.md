# Forge-Example-1.20.1



### Hey! consider looking into:

- gradle.properties (some configurations)

- src/resources/META-INF/mods.toml (here some configuration)
 
Also change package name in ExampleMod.java
first line 
````
package net.pawel3k1.example;
````

Here you can put for example net.yourname.yourmod; 

Etc. etc. 



Have fun modding! its ready to go 1.20.1 forge
